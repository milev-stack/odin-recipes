        <h2>How to Make</h2>
        <p>Baking a salmon may be the easiest way to ensure it comes out right, and this recipe is no different. 
            All your ingredients go into a baking dish together—the salmon, lemon slices, onion rings, wine, orange juice, and sauce—and that will roast for 10 to 12 minutes at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C), followed by a quick 3-minute broil.</p>
            <p>While the time required to bake salmon can vary depending on the size of your filet, 10 minutes should be a good starting point for a bake such as this recipe. 
            Here’s a good rule of thumb: Every inch of thickness requires about 10 minutes to cook. 
            If your filet isn’t quite an inch thick, maybe cook it for 8 minutes. 
            If it’s a little more, however, maybe 12 minutes. A cooking thermometer will be a key tool if you want to get your salmon just right. 
            If the internal temperature is at 145 degrees, you’re good to go.</p>
            <p>The harissa sauce is what brings this recipe to life. Harissa is a spicy, tangy, peppery red chili paste that originally hails from Tunisia and is popular in North African and Middle Eastern cooking. This recipe combines harissa with mayonnaise, lemon juice, and smoked paprika, so the result will be a slightly spicy sauce, but one that is packed full of flavor. 
                If you want it spicier, just add a little more harissa or smoked paprika.</p>
