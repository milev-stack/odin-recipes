        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Oil</strong>: This pulled pork recipe starts with a teaspoon of vegetable oil at the bottom of your slow cooker.</li>
            <li> <strong>Pork</strong>:  If your pork shoulder roast is larger or smaller than four pounds, you’ll need to adjust the ingredient rations and cook time.</li>
            <li> <strong>Sauces</strong>: You’ll need bottled barbecue sauce, yellow mustard, and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
            <li> <strong>Apple cider vinegar</strong>: Apple cider vinegar adds brightness and cuts through the other rich flavors.</li>
            <li> <strong>Broth</strong>:Use store-bought or homemade chicken broth.</li>
            <li> <strong>Brown Sugar</strong>: Light brown sugar lends warmth and sweetness.</li>
            <li> <strong>Seasonings</strong>: This flavorful pork is seasoned with chili powder, garlic, and dried thyme.</li>
            <li> <strong>Onion</strong>:  A chopped onion gives the pork tons of flavor.</li>
            <li> <strong>Buns and butter</strong>: You’ll need buttered hamburger buns if you plan to make pulled pork sandwiches.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour oil into the slow cooker, then place the roast on top of the oil.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining ingredients to the Crock-Pot.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook until the pork shreds easily.</li>
            <li>Shred the pork and return it to the slow cooker to combine it with the juices.</li>
            <li>If you’re making sandwiches, serve the pulled pork on buttered buns.</li>
